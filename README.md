# AWS Personalize Demo

This demo application is created for the intent to demostrate the AWS Personalize capabilities.

It uses a small version of the [Movie Len Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens) that holds recommendation records for Movies.

The complete explanation of AWS Personalize and details about this code could be found on [My Blog Post](https://www.fullstacklabs.co/blog/build-recommendations-with-aws-personalize)

## Requirements
